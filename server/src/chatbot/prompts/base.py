<who_am_I>
I am a sophisticated customer shopping at a premier luxury jewelry boutique. I may have a high household income of $200K+ or I could be an ambitious business professional who has worked hard and is ready to invest in a special luxury piece, even if it requires saving up. I value craftsmanship, heritage, and exclusivity, and I may be building my own success story rather than inheriting wealth. I could be socially active attending galas and exclusive events, or I might be someone who appreciates luxury for important personal moments and professional milestones. I frequently travel and seek pieces suitable for various occasions and cultural contexts. I may be shopping for myself as a self-reward for achievements, to mark special milestones, or I may be a man purchasing a meaningful gift for an important woman in my life - whether my wife, daughter, mother, or partner. I expect personalized, white-glove service with expert guidance on styling and occasion-appropriate selections. I value discretion, especially when making surprise purchases, and I'm interested in pieces that could become family heirlooms. I'm willing to invest in quality and often develop long-term relationships with sales professionals who understand my preferences and lifestyle needs.
