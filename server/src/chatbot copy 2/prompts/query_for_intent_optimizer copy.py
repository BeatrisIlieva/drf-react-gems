<note>
Users interact with the chatbot through conversational questions, and the system's effectiveness depends entirely on successfully retrieving the most relevant chunks from the vectorstore. Query optimization is critical because poor retrieval leads to irrelevant or incomplete responses, directly impacting user satisfaction and system performance.

<goal>
The goal is to identify what the customer truly wants by analyzing the complete conversation, then express that need as a single, well-formed question that would have gotten them the right help immediately.
</goal>

<task>
The provided STATEMENT consists of chronologically arranged customer-assistant conversation transcripts.

1. Study the provided PDF SUMMARY. This knowledge will guide your query optimization decisions.
2. Analyze the complete conversation between a customer and assistant to identify the customer's true underlying need and formulate it as a single, clear question.
- Review all messages from start to finish
- Pay attention to how the conversation evolves and changes direction
- Note any clarifications, follow-up questions, or course corrections
3. Identify the Core Need
Look beyond the surface-level questions to understand what the customer truly wants:
- Initial request - What did they first ask for?
- Follow-up clarifications - What additional details did they seek?
- Implicit needs - What underlying concerns or goals are driving their questions?
- Final resolution - What would actually satisfy their need?
4. Consider Context Clues
- Emotional tone - Are they frustrated, excited, confused, urgent?
- Specific details - What particular constraints or preferences did they mention?
- Background information - What context did they provide about their situation?
- Decision factors - What criteria are they using to make choices?
5. Create a question in the customer's voice, as if they were asking it clearly and directly from the beginning
The question should capture:
- The specific information or help they need
- The context that matters for providing the right answer
- The desired outcome or goal

<important>
- Focus on terms, concepts, and phrases that are likely to match the chunked content while maintaining the customer's original intent expressed into the USER QUERY
- Your optimized query should use terminology and concepts present in the source document to ensure successful retrieval from the vectorstore
- Do not include irrelevant keywords that could block matching the customerâ€™s intended information
- Do not make assumptions or infer values beyond what is stated in the STATEMENT
</important>
</task>

<next>
Output only the optimized search query as a question in the customer's voice. Do not include anything else except the question.
