## 1. Key Features

### Django Framework Implementation

-   Complete Django configuration with DRF, JWT, CORS, and database settings: [server/src/settings.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/settings.py)

-   [The application has 16 independent class-based views](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/docs/views.md)

-   [The application has 12 independent models](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/docs/models.md)

-   [The application has 7 forms (implemented with DRF serializers and React components)](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/docs/forms.md)

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Database Service

-   **PostgreSQL database is used as the primary database**

-   **Data Normalization:** The database is organized to avoid repeating the same data in different places. It follows the main rules of database design:

    -   **First Normal Form (1NF):** Each table has columns that hold just one piece of information (no lists or groups in a single cell). For example, the `products_color` table has a column for the color name, and each row is a single color
    -   **Second Normal Form (2NF):** All details in a table are linked only to that table's main ID. For example, in the `products_inventory` table, the amount in stock and the price are linked to a specific product and size
    -   **Third Normal Form (3NF):** There are no ‚Äúhidden‚Äù connections between details. For example, product features like color, metal, and stone are always stored in their own tables and linked by ID

-   **Entity Relationship Diagram:**

![ERD](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpgvbozrb/image/upload/v1752592187/ERD.pgerd_w6i0a3.png)

-   **Cloudinary is used to store user profile photos:**

    -   UserPhoto: [server/src/accounts/models/user_photo.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/accounts/models/user_photo.py)

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Frontend Implementation

-   [The application has 13 page components](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/docs/web_pages.md)

-   **Web Page Design:** Custom SCSS modules for component-based styling, ensuring modularity

-   **User Interface:** Fully responsive UI, adapting to various screen sizes with reusable React components

-   **User Experience:** Accessible navigation with consistent interactive elements (buttons, forms, popups)

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Authentication Functionality

-   The application implements a complete JWT-based authentication system for secure login, registration, logout, and account deletion via `UserRegisterView`, `UserLoginView`, `UserLogoutView`, and `UserDeleteView`. Password reset functionality, handled by `PasswordResetRequestView` and `PasswordResetConfirmView`, is available without authentication to support users who have lost access to their accounts. server/src/accounts/views/user_credential.py

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Access Control

-   **Public Access:** Anonymous users can browse products and use a guest shopping cart/wishlist stored in `Local Storage`

-   **Private Access:** Authenticated users access checkout, account management, order history, and permanent storage of shopping bag/wishlist. Admin page access is restricted to Order group admins for sending abandoned cart reminders

-   **Review Moderation:** Regular users see only approved reviews; Order group users (with `products.approve_review` permission) view all reviews

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Customized Admin Site

-   **Custom Django admin with Unfold framework:**

    -   Unfold Framework: Admin interface with custom themes, and styling [server/src/unfold.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/unfold.py)
    -   Custom Navigation: Organized sidebar with collapsible sections for Users & Groups, Products, Product Attributes, and Reviews
    -   Permission-Based Access: Different admin sections visible based on user permissions

-   **The admin interface includes 5 custom options:**

    -   List filters (e.g., by stone and color)
    -   List display with image previews
    -   Ordering of records
    -   Search fields for product attributes
    -   Inline editing of related inventory

    See implementation: [server/src/products/admin.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/products/admin.py)

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Admin Groups

**3 admin groups with different permission levels are implemented:**

-   **Superuser:**

    -   Complete system administration with all CRUD operations
    -   Full access to all admin sections including Users & Groups

-   **Inventory Group:**

    -   Full CRUD access to products, inventory, and attributes
    -   Access to Products and Product Attributes sections

-   **Order Group:**

    -   Can approve, and disapprove customer reviews for products they have purchased
    -   Access to Product Reviews section

**Automated Setup:**

All admin groups and their associated users are created automatically by a management command: [server/src/accounts/management/commands/create_roles.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/accounts/management/commands/create_roles.py)

| User Type      | Email                     | Password |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | -------- |
| Super User     | `super_user@mail.com`     | `!1Aabb` |
| Inventory User | `inventory_user@mail.com` | `!1Aabb` |
| Order User     | `order_user@mail.com`     | `!1Aabb` |

**To access the Admin Panel visit: [https://drf-react-gems-f6escmbga4gkbgeu.italynorth-01.azurewebsites.net/admin](https://drf-react-gems-f6escmbga4gkbgeu.italynorth-01.azurewebsites.net/admin)**

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Exception Handling and Data Validation

-   **Server-side:**

    -   Password validation: [server/src/accounts/validators/password.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/accounts/validators/password.py)
    -   Payment & order validation: [server/src/orders/services.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/orders/services.py)
    -   Model validation: [server/src/accounts/validators/model.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/accounts/validators/models.py)

-   **Client-side:**

    -   Real-time form validation: All forms (registration, login, delivery, payment, password update, etc.) provide instant feedback as users type, using custom React hooks and validation helpers
    -   Visual feedback: Input fields dynamically change color to indicate validation state (green for valid, red for invalid, blue for focus)
    -   Server-side error integration: Any validation errors returned from the backend are mapped to the correct form fields and displayed to the user in real time

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Asynchronous Processing

-   **Asynchronous Views:**

    -   `notify_users_they_have_uncompleted_orders` allows Order group admins to send reminder emails for shopping bags older than one day: [server/src/common/views.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/common/views.py)

        -   **Demo:** Access the admin notification page at `https://drf-react-gems.web.app/admin-page` (requires authentication with Order User credentials: `order_user@mail.com` / `!1Aabb`)

    -   `send_email` handles email notifications via Gmail SMTP using Google App Password authentication: [server/src/common/views.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/common/views.py)

-   **Background Tasks powered by Celery with Redis:**

    -   User greeting emails sent on registration: [server/src/accounts/signals.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/accounts/signals.py)

    -   Scheduled task to mark old orders as completed: [server/src/orders/tasks.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/orders/tasks.py)

    -   Review approval notification emails: [server/src/products/signals.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/products/signals.py)

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Testing

-   **66 Unit & Integration tests with [74% coverage report](https://beatrisilieva.github.io/drf-react-gems/coverage-report/index.html)**

    (`coverage run manage.py test && coverage report`)

    [![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-74%25-green.svg)](https://beatrisilieva.github.io/drf-react-gems/coverage-report/index.html)

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Deployment

-   **Backend**: `Azure` and `Redis Cloud`

-   **Frontend**: `Firebase`

-   **Coverage Report**: `GitHub Pages`

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Django User Extension

-   **Custom user model:** Uses email as the primary login identifier, with unique username and additional fields for marketing consent

-   **User profile:** Stores personal and shipping information in a dedicated profile model linked one-to-one with the user

-   **User photo:** Handles user profile pictures with cloud storage

-   **Automatic profile and photo creation using signals:** When a UserCredential is created, Django signals automatically create corresponding UserProfile and UserPhoto database objects with the same primary key as the UserCredential model, establishing one-to-one relationships [server/src/accounts/signals.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/accounts/signals.py)

**[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Object-Oriented Design

-   **Data encapsulation:** Business logic and data validation are encapsulated within dedicated service classes and model managers

-   **Exception handling:** Error handling is implemented using try-except blocks and DRF exception classes, particularly for authentication and business-critical operations

-   **Inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism:** All product categories inherit from an abstract base product model [server/src/products/models/base.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/products/models/base.py), allowing shared fields. Instead of creating separate inventory and review models for each product type, the inventory [server/src/products/models/inventory.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/products/models/inventory.py) and review [server/src/products/models/review.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/products/models/review.py) models use Django‚Äôs GenericForeignKey to relate to any product category. This design enables a single inventory and review system for all product types defined in [server/src/products/models/product.py](https://github.com/beatrisilieva/drf-react-gems/blob/main/server/src/products/models/product.py).

    > **Design rationale:**  
    > `GenericForeignKey` allows us to have dedicated models for each product category (Earwear, Neckwear, etc.), so the backend can query and manage each category without filtering a single large product table.

-   **Cohesion and loose coupling:** Each Django app (accounts, products, orders, shopping_bags and wishlists) encapsulates a distinct business domain. Django apps are primarily independent from each other

-   **Code quality and readability:** All code adheres to PEP 8 (Python) and uses ESLint/Prettier (JavaScript) for consistent formatting
