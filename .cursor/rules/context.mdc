# Plan

The current project is a DRF + React online e-commerce website. Analize the entire code into the server (the DRF part of the app). We are going to work ONLY on the SERVER! Do not change existing logic as it is working perfectly well. The main goal is that you analize the server code and write comments documentation about every single line explaining how it works. I am a beginner so I need to understand the code in details. For example why ‘prefetch_related’ or ‘select_related’, or GenericForeignKey are used (add information about what is GenericForeignKey - content_type, object_id, why is it used, what problems it solves), why at the given place not a model serialiser is used but just a serialiser, why the method to_representation is overwritten, why classes are nested inside another classes, why the given error handling is used,  what this line, this function, this class is achieving and why it is implemented like it is - what is the reason for the given implementation, what are its benefits. Do that for all the files that do NOT come by default from Django like asgi and wigsi. Include all the files that contain custom logic. Skip the unfold.py and the files inside the management directories and the static folder. I need everybody including me a beginner in Django and ecpecially DRF, to understand the code entirely from the comments without having to turn on the IDE debugger. Write the comments documentation in a professional way. After you complete with the comments for a specific file, add a unit/integration test for the file and run it so we can assure it is passing. There is a directory tests at the level of the src in the server directory with already predifined directories that follow the structure inside the src. The views tests include into a views directory, the serializers tests include into serializers directory, validators tests include into a validators directory and so on. Follow best practices and Triple A pattern when writing the tests and naming the test functions. Create `def setUp(self):` function where it is suitable for the tests. Use in the tests `self.factory = RequestFactory()`; this pattern to create the request `request = self.factory.get(reverse('earwear-list’))`; this pattern `response = EarwearListView.as_view()(request)` to get the response, whenever they are applicable. Document well with comments each test as well.
